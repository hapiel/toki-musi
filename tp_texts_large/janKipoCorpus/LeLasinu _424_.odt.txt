[Red Riding Hood

Red Riding Hood was a girl and had a red hood and wore it all the time.  One day her grandmother was sick.  So her mother sent her to her grandmother's house with a parcel of good food.  If she went to her gramdmother's house, she went inside the dark woods.  In the dark country, she happened upon a big dark beast.  This beast said "Hello, little girl, where are you going?"  She replied to the beast "Hello, beast.  My grandmother is sick. I am taking a parcel of to her."  The beast said "Fare well."  He ran awa quickly.  The beast went to the house of the grandmother and went inside and ate the woman in just one gulp.  After that, the beast put on the woman's clothes and lay on the bed.  Finally, Red Riding Hood came to the end of the woods and her grandmother's house.  She went in and saw the beast on the bed.  
The girl said "Grandmother, you have a big head."  The grandmother replied "I have it because I want to cook".   The girl said "Grandmother, you have big eyes".  The grandmother replied "I have them so I see you better."  Red Riding Hood said "Grandmother, you have big teeth."  The grandmother replied "I have them so that I  eat you better" and got up quickly and ate girl in one gulp.  But he discarded the red hood.  A woodsman saw the hood and went inside the house. He learned what had happened and chopped the beast and brought out the grandmother and Red Riding Hood.  They were not dead.  A year later, Red Riding Hood and the woodsman were married and lived continually happy.]
