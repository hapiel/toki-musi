A first couple of words

A long time ago, poets of France and Britain and Wales came to talk about kings and magicians and warriors.  These tales were not writings but just talk.  One magician in these tales was Merlin.  His name was "Merlin" or "Myrrdin" in Celtic languages.  Everybody liked these tales.  In this situation, writes came to write tales about Merlin. 

Geoffrey of Montmouth was a scholar in Wales. He wrote many books: "Prophecies of Merlin", "History of the Kings of Britain" and "Life of Merlin."  Geoffrey wrote in Latin.  His tales said that Merlin was a king.  Another king fought him.  He went to the woods.  He went crazy. But he knew the future.   

Then Chretien de Troyes wote many books abut King Arthur in French.  Kings and warriors and schollars of that time read these tales.  They liked these tales. 

Robert de Boron was a scholar in France.  He wrote and bunch of books about Merlin and Arthur.  He wrote all the tales about the people you know.  He wrote in French.

I am Frédéric.  I like the tales of Robert de Boron.  I wanted to write Robert's tales in toki pona.  Here are these tales.
Adrien and Paul are my sons, aged five and nine.  They don't speak toki pona.  So I tell the tales to them in French. They like these tales.  So they drew colored pictures for this book.  


Two Sisters

A long time ago, there was a demon.  He was a very powerful spirit.  But he was lonesome and wanted a child.  He looked for a mother for his future child.

In Britain, he saw two women.  These women had the same parents.  They looked good to the demon.  The demon followed the two women.  When the women were sick because of this, they went to the house of a very wise man. The wise man saw the demon and told the women "Every night, you lock yourselves in your bedrooms.  If you light candles behind your doors, the demon cannot come in"

The women did this many times.  The demon could not go to the bedrooms or the women.  But he was very smart.  He put evil in the feelings of the women.  The two women fought with each other.  They said many spiteful things.  When the women felt bad, they went to their rooms.  One woman lit the candle.  But the other woman didn't.  The demon was very happy.  He made no noise when he went into the woman's bedroom. Nobody knows what happened in the bedroom.  But next day the woman was sick.  She said "Damn!  Last night I had a bad dream.  My inside is a baby bump because of the bad dream" 

At night she bore a monstrous child.  He was very ugly.  There was a lot of hair all over his body.  The head and limbs of the baby were like the limbs and head of a beast.
The woman prayed "Good spirit of plants and animals, I call upon you.  Make my child good looking."

She cried a lot.  These tears washed the head of the infant.  Immediately, all the hair went away  The animal limbs went away.  The animal head went away. The baby was beautiful.  The woman was very happy.  She told the infant "You are the child of good and evil.  You are Merlin." 
Merlin became a magician with good power and evil power.  He could see the past and the future.  He could bring about what he wanted. 

Two Dragons 

A long time ago, Vortigern was rule of Britain.  He was very wicked.  He stole the throne of the dead king.  He murdered a son of the dead king.  But another son did not die and fled.  Vortigern was angry because of that boy.  He wanted to build a tower.  This building would be very big and very tall.  Nobody would be able to attack this building.  The construction was on a big hill.  But when the walls were little, they fell apart and became a lot of gravel.  Several times, people built the walls. But every time the walls fell apart.  Wise men told Vortigern "Walls using mortar and the blood of a child can go high. This child should be seven years old.  He should not have a father."  The warriors of the king went out and looked for this child.  The warriors went to the city.  Merlin came to them and said "You need me.  I am seven years old.  I don't have a father."  The warriors heard this strange message.  They sent to child to Vortigern.  

Merlin said "O King, I will tell something about the crumbling tower.  Two dragons sleep under the hill.  The wall presses on the backs of the dragons. They twist around and destroy the big building.  If I lie, you may burn me."  

The king's workmen worked inside the hill.  They found two big stones.  They worked inside stone and saw a dragon.  This dragon was white and big and flew and roared terribly.  They worked inside the other stone and saw another dragon.  This dragon as red and very big.  The two dragons saw eachother. The fought and sliced and flamed.  The battle lasted three days.  The red dragon slashed to vitals of the white dragone.  The white dragon died and fell and became a fireball.  The red dragon took off.  Nobody saw him.  
Vortigern said to Merlin "You will speak knowledgeably about this battle."  Merlin said "The white dragon is you.  The red dragon is Uther and is the son of the dead king.  In three days, Uther will come and kill you just as the white dragon is dead because of the red dragon."
Vortigern was very frightened because of this.  He sealed himself in his house.  But Uther came and razed the house.  Vortigern died .  Uther became king of Britain.  Merlin became Uther's wise man and magician.  


Two Husbands

When Uther became king of Britain, he wanted to get a wife.  For many days the king's court traveled in the country.  But Uther did not see a woman who looked good to him.
One day they came to Cornwall.  This is a pretty country on the shore of the ocean.In this country one can see grass and many beasts.    
The castle Tintagel is in this country, beside the sea and under a very big rock,  Because of this, nobody can attack this building.  Tintagel is the palace of Gorlois and Ygerne.  Gorlois is the king of Cornwall.  Ygerne is his wife.  When Uther saw beautiful Ygerne, he loved her.  At that time, Gorlois was away at war.  Uther was happy because of that.  He spoke his love to Ygerne.  But Ygerne said "O King, I love my husband only.  Don't speak your love to me.  Go away to your own country."
Uther didn't go.  He bought precious jewels and beautiful expensive clothes.  He sent them to Ygerne.  But Ygerne did not receive them.  She locked herself in Tintagel and did not talk to Uther.  
Uther attacked the castle.  But tintagel is under a very big stone .  Nobody can attack this building.  Uther was feeling very bad because of this.  He did not have a way to Ygerne. Merlin knew everything.  He knew the desolation of Uther.  He came to Uther and said "O king, why are you sad?"
"I am going crazy because of my love for Ygerne.  All day and night I want to see her.  But she has locked herself in her castle.  Can you do this?"
"O King, I don't want to do this.  Ygerne is the wife of Gorlois.  This is evil."
"Merin, if you do this, I will give all my possessions to you."
Merlin  saw the future and said "O King, I will do this.  But tonight you and Ygerne  will make a baby.  I want that baby.  Only you and I can know this.  Do you like this?"
"Yes"
Merlin cast a very powerful spell.  This spell was the name of a dragon.  Uther became exactly like Gorlois.  No one could see the difference between Uther and Gorlois.  Merlin told him "Go to Ygerne's castle.  You will get what you desire."
Uther went to Tintagel.  Ygerne saw him as her husband and took the man in her arms.  She gave her mouth to him.  They went to the bedroom.  
That night, Gorlois dies in a battle.  Ygerne learned that her lover was not Gorlois.  But she did not know who it was.  Later Uther became Ygerne's husband. 
The child came and got the name "Arthur".  But on his second day, Arthur was gone.  Ygerne was very sad because of that.  The king's servants looked throughout the country.  But nobody found Arthur.  Only Uther knew that Arthur was with Merlin.


Two Magicians 

One day Merlin was walking in the forest of Broce'liande. He liked the woodlands.  He cast a spell and became a large beast.  This beast had white legs and large horns.  He went like the wind and talked to birds and trees.  He came to the edge of a spring.  There a woman was gathering plants.  She said "Oh, come here, very beautiful beast." 
Merlin came to her.  The woman took him in her arms and said "What is your name?"
"I am Merlin." Merlin said.  Immediately, he became a man. The woman was frightened by this and said ""Oh, you are a demon."
"No.  I am a magician and Uther's wise man. What is your name?"
The woman looked at Merline and knew that he was good.  "I am Viviane.  I am the child of Lord Dymas."
All day, Merlin and Viviane talked about many things and laughed.  When night came, Viviane said "The moon  is rising.  I have to go to my father's castle.  But I want to see you again."  
Every day, Merlin came back to the woodlands.  Every day, Merlin and Viviane talked and played.  They loved each other.  But play time cannot be all time.  One day, Merlin told Viviane "I love you.  I always want to stay with you. But I am Merlin.  I am the wise man of the king.  I cannot stay here.  I am going.  But in a little while I will come with you."  
"I too love you.  I will wait for you here.  But I want one thing."  
"What do you want?"
"I want to be a magician like you."
Merlin was happy because his beloved would be a magician.  He said "I will teach you all my knowledge."
He talked to Viviane and taught the first spell.  After the lesson, Viviane cast this spell.  She became a butterfly and was very happy and laughed.  Merlin said "For the first time, I heard laughter from a butterfly."
Merlin became a beast.  The beast and the bug went to the woodland.  They went like the wind.  They were very happy.  After that, Merlin often came to Viviane So Viviane became a very powerful magician.  
Merlin build a crystal palace for Viviane.  But everyone can see through crystal.  So Merlin enclosed the palace with a lake.  Viviane was inside this palace.  So everybody called her  "the lady in the lake."


Two Swords 

You remember that Merlin took little Arthur.  For many years, Merlin taught many things to Arthur.  Arthur grew up and became strong and a good warrior and a wise man too.  
Then Uther fought the people from Saxony.  Once he drank water from a spring.  But an enemy had put poison in the spring.  Uther was sick because of the water.  At night he died from it.  Uther did not have a known son.  So the warriors of Britain fought each other. They wanted to become the king of Britain.  Merlin felt bad because of this blood.   He spoke to all the warriors.  
"Warrior, come to Camelot .  A spell will teach you who will become the king of Britain."
The warrior all came to Camelot. They saw a great sword embedded in a big stone.  This was written on the back of the sword "Whoever releases me is the king of Britain."  All the warrior pulled on the sword.  But tht sword did not move and stayed in the stone.  The warrior could not release it.  Merlin said "Arthur is hear.  He too wants to pull."  Arthur pulled the sword.  The sword came out of its rocky container.  The warriors said "Who is Arthur?"  Merlin said "Warriors, bend your knees.  Arthur is the son of Uther. Arthur is the new king."
Arthur became king of Britain.  Merlin became wise man and magician of the king.
.....

 
One day, Arthur was fighting Pellinor.  This battle was in the forest of Broceliande, on the shore of a lake.  Pellinor was strong.  He cut Arthur a lot.  Arthur shed a lot of blood.  The Pellinor gave one cut of great force.  Arthur's sword was broken.  He went like the wind to the shore of the lake. There was one boat there.  Arthur got into the boat and plied the oars.  Pellinor also was near the lake.  But there was not another boat.  Pellinor insulted Arthur.  Arthur said to himself "If nobody come, I am dead. I wish Merlin were here.  I want to talk with him."   
Arthur did not know that Viviane was in the lake.  She heard Arthur's talk.  Arthur looked at the water.  An arm came from the lake.  The arm held a beautiful big sword.  Arthur came to the arm.  He hear a voice.  This voice said "O King, take this sword.  Its name is "Excalibur".  This sword is good for you.  This sword is a magic sword of great power.  While you have it, nobody can kill you."  Arthur took the sword .  He looked at the sword.  This sword was beautiful and bright looking.  There was a spell written on it.  "O, Lady of the Lake, thank you.  I don't know who you are.  But I want you as a friend of the king's court. If you want anything, you can get my possessions."  The arm went into the lake.  On the shore of the lake, Pellinor saw this.  He knew that he was going crazy.  He said "Arthur, you have a sword.  So, come fight. Die."   "I am coming.  I am coming to fight you.  You are coming to die."
Arther came close to Pellinor.  Then two warriors slashed the same.  But when Pellinor cut Arthur, Excalibur cut him many times.  The Arthur slashed Pellinor. He died.  Arthur said "I am very strong.  No one can fight me.  I am like a spirit."


Two Butterflies

Morgan was a magician of King Arthur.  She was the daughter of Ygerne and Gorlois. Mordred was Morgan's son.  They were in the king's court.  Arthur was good to them.  But Mordred wanted something more from people.  He very much wanted to be king. One day he told this to Morgan. 
Morgan wanted to give her child what he wanted and made a very strong sleeping potion.  Mordred gave this drink to Arthur in wine.  Later, he became sleepy and went to his bedroom.  That night Mordred went to the king's bedroom. He didn't make a noise.  Because of the sleeping potion Arthur slept soundly. Mordred had a sword in his clothes.  He attacked the vitals of the king.  Arthur did not speak and died.  Mordred traveled like the wind.  
Next day the servants saw the king dead and told this to everyone. Everyone was sad because of this disaster.  Only Mordred was happy. He spoke to the king's court "Warriors of Britain, the king is dead.  I am sad because of this.  But our country needs a king.  Unfortunately, Arthur had no son.  I am the child of Ygerne.  So I am close kin of Arthur.  You are less close to Arthur.  So I ought to become the new king."
The warriors did not want to fight each other. So Mordred became king.   
But Morgan and Mordred were worried because Merlin knew the past.  He knew who attacked Arthur.  So they wanted Merlin dead.  They knew a path to this.  The court went to the forest of Broceliande.  They wanted to hunt.  Morgan and Mordred escaped from the group.  They went to the spring in the woods. They knew that Merlin was at that spring.  
Morgan cast a spell.  Because of it, Merlin's mouth became stone.  He could not speak.  He went crazy because of this. He wanted to cast a spell to battle Morgan.  But his mouth could not open.  Morgan said "Mordred, slash him"  Mordred got his sword.  He went to Merlin.  He drew his sword. 
But Viviane was behind a tree.  Nobody saw her. She felt very bad because of Morgan and Mordred.  She cast a spell.  Immediately, Merlin became like a butterfly.  He flew and went to the side of Viviane and landed on Viviane's head.  Morgan and Mordred saw Viviane.  Morgan said "My child, slash those two."   
But Viviane cast another spell.  Morgan and Mordred became like disgusting beasts.  Then the troop of warriors came and hunted them.  They shot arrows.  Morgan and Mordred died.
Merlin, as a butterfly, spoke to Viviane.  "My love, thank you.  You saved me. The first time we saw each other, I knew that you would save me.  Today I am not dead because of you. But I don't want to be in the world of men.  From now on, I want to stay a butterfly.  Viviane told Merlin "My love, if you want to stay a butterfly, I too will become like a butterfly.  In the future we will stay in Broceliande forest.  Viviane cast a spell and became like him.  The two butterflies flew away. After that, nobody saw them 

In the future, Britain did not have a king.  Warriors from new countries fought it.  Angles and Saxons came into Britain.  The lethally fought many wars in Britain.  Britain became England. But that is another story.
