(A brief attempt at conversational TP! Emoticon smile )


John Clifford "The gas (?coffee?) is in the coldly wet inside"? ?'lon insa pi telo lete' "is inside the cold water"? mi sona ala. 

Chris Howlett mi pakala. telo pimeja li lon insa pali. ken la ni li kule pimeja jelo. tan ni, la pali li tawa sike pona. tan pi telo lete, la pali li seli mute ala.Does that make things clearer?

  John Clifford At a guess, "oil (maybe 'ko pimeja') is inside the engine ('ilo pali/tawa') Maybe it ('ona' better) is brown colored. Therefore (prob 'tan ona' or even 'kepeken ona' "because of it") the engine goes circularly well (maybe just 'ilo li pali', not sure what goes around unless this is a Wankel) Because of the snow, the engine is not very hot".

Chris Howlett I was indeed aiming for "oil" ("dark liquid; maybe dark yellow; because of it the engine goes round well", your point about a Wankel notwithstanding!), which has got in the coolant ("cold liquid, because of which the engine doesn't get too hot").
